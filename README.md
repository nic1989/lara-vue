Vue.js directory structure with following packages/functionality. 

- **vuex** with modules 
- **router** with meta
- services with token based access
- environment variable
- filters.
- **pages and component** structure

This structure might be helpful in your large project/application, However Vue doesn't really restrict how you structure your code.
